class == type (kind of)
we can create classes / types by:

1. using named tuples
2. declaring a new class with the class keyword

To make a value of the type you created (of the class)

1. call new type as if it were a function
2. instantiation (create an instance of a class)
3. constructor (function used to create instance)

classes
=======
the init method defines the behavior of your class whena new instance is created

within init, you can specify the attributes (data) that
your instance has

a class + the init method ... your blueprint for any object of that type
